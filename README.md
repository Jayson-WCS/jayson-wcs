# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Jay

## Retired top athlete transitioning to **web development**.

### Junior Full Stack Developer --- Wilder 2023

I have been interested in technology for many years but never dared to learn it because of the stigma of the industry.

I am very pleasantly surprised by the pleasure I feel at having finally taken the plunge!

My life project is oriented around this one in order to write a new page in my life.
