# 👋🏾 Hey there I'm Jay ! 

## Former athlete turned **front-end developer** with a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. 

### Junior Full Stack Developer --- Wilder 2023

### Currently seeking a **sandwich course** opportunity starting in September.

I specialize in **SCSS**, **JavaScript** and **React**, and yet I'm constantly honing my **UI/UX** skills through self-learning with **Figma** and practicing with components libraries like **Chakra UI**.

I thrive in collaborative environments, solving complex problems and providing creative solutions. 

Let's build something extraordinary together !
